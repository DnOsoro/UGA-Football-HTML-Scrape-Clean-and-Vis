# UGA-Football-HTML-Scrape-Clean-and-Vis
In this project, I scraped the UGA Football website for player data, cleaned and transformed it, handled nulls and duplicates, and split strings into multiple columns. I created dictionaries, functions, and visualizations, including BMI and weight class analyses, using pandas, BeautifulSoup, numpy, matplotlib, and requests.
