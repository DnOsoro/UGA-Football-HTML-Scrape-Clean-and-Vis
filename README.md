# UGA-Football-HTML-Scrape-Clean-and-Vis
In this project, I scraped the UGA Football website for player data, including height, weight, and hometown, as of 2022. I expertly cleaned and transformed the data, handling null values, duplicates, and string splitting. I developed functions, created dictionaries, and crafted visualizations to analyze data distributions and values, culminating in BMI and weight class visualizations. Despite not being familiar with football or BMI, my code and visuals effectively told a compelling story. Tools used: pandas, BeautifulSoup, numpy, matplotlib, and requests.
